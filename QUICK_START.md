# Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

1. **Maven Project Structure** - `pom.xml` with all necessary dependencies
2. **Package Structure** - All required directories created
3. **Configuration Files** - `application.properties` for dev/prod profiles
4. **Main Application Class** - `ExpenseTrackerApplication.java`
5. **Project Documentation** - Comprehensive plan in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`

## 🎯 Next Steps - Waiting for Your Input

Before we proceed with Phase 2 (Authentication & Security), please confirm:

### 1. Database Choice
- **MySQL** (default, already configured)
- **PostgreSQL** (I'll update the configuration)

### 2. Your Experience Level
- **Beginner**: I'll explain every step in detail
- **Intermediate**: I'll provide code with brief explanations
- **Advanced**: I'll focus on architecture and best practices

### 3. Timeline
- How many weeks do you have?
- This helps me prioritize features

### 4. Build Tool
- **Maven** (already set up) ✅
- **Gradle** (if you prefer)

## 🚀 Once You Confirm

I'll immediately start building:

### Phase 2: Authentication & Security
1. User Entity & Repository
2. Spring Security Configuration
3. JWT Token Service
4. Authentication Controller (Register/Login)
5. Security Filters

### Then Phase 3-8 will follow systematically!
